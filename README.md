👋 Hi, I’m Robson Müller, a Data Engineer interested in developing solutions for data processing, but also to extract value out of the data, So I am very connected to the Business or Human kind problems, and seeking to solve them using code, analysis, critical thinking and creativity. 

📚 My main interest at the moment are around deploying solutions with microservice architecture, Infra as Code, and Machine Learning to take value out of the available data. 
In addition I am sharpening C++ and learning Golang from a real project. 

🚴Iam an assiduous practitioner of sports, especially the outdoor ones, like climbing, trekking and triathlon. I believe the practice of Endurence sports helps us develop soft skills such as mental resilience, comprehension, focus and self leadership, which can be applied in daily life.

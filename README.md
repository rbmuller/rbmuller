👋 Hi, I’m Robson Müller, a Data Engineer interested in developing solutions for data processing, but also to extract value out of the data, So I am very connected to the Business or Human kind problems, and seeking to solve them using code, analysis, critical thinking and creativity. 

📚 My main interest at the moment is around deploying solutions with microservice architecture and also going deep into ML. 
In addition I am sharpening C++, Java and Scala. 

🚴Iam an assiduous practitioner of sports, especially the outdoor ones, such as climbing, trekking and triathlon. I believe the practice of Endurence sports helps us develop soft skills such as mental resilience, comprehension, focus and self leadership, which can be applied in daily life. 

⚙️ In the free time, I am developing an open package for being used by Starting Data Engineers in order to speed up their developments.
